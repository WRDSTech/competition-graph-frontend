Investors can learn about potential risks and opportunities associated with other connected entities through these corporate connections. Nonetheless, human annotation of a large corpus to extract such relationships is highly time-consuming, not to mention that it requires a considerable amount of industry expertise and professional training. Meanwhile, we have yet to observe means to generate reliable knowledge graphs of corporate relationships due to the lack of impartial and granular data sources. This study proposes a system to process financial reports and construct the public competitor graph to fill the void. Our method can retrieve more than 83% competition relationship of the S&P 500 index companies. Based on the output from our system, we construct a knowledge graph with more than 700 nodes and 1200 edges.
